# CrocodileSort
This is my own sorting algorithm

It was inspired by Stalin sort, i later found out my algorithm is similar to strand sort.

It has a strange average time complexity of O(nÂ²/log(n)) with a more standard space complexity of O(n)

There is two variant of this algorithm:
  - a non stable one (CrocoSort) that better deals with reversed sorted list.
  - a stable one (DoubleCrocoSort).
